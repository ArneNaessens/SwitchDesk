# VLANs

## On one switch

The **VLANs** tab of a switch lists its VLANs with name, IP address, and untagged and tagged ports. **New VLAN**, **Edit** and **Delete** change them. VLAN 1 can't be deleted.

### Edit ports by clicking

Each port is a button. Clicking cycles it through:

- **U** untagged (an access port in this VLAN)
- **T** tagged (a trunk carrying this VLAN)
- off (not a member)

Change the name in the same dialog. **Save to startup config** runs `write memory` at the end, so the change survives a reboot; untick it to try something out first.

### Review before sending

**Review changes** shows the exact lines that will be sent, for example on AOS-S:

```text
configure terminal
vlan 10
untagged 7
tagged 8
exit
end
write memory
```

and on AOS-CX:

```text
configure terminal
vlan 30
exit
interface 1/1/49
no routing
vlan trunk allowed 30
exit
end
```

**Apply to switch** sends them one by one and shows the switch's replies. If the switch rejects a line, SwitchDesk stops there, and `write memory` is never reached, so nothing half-done gets saved. Afterwards the switch is read again so the tables update.

!!! note "Instant On"
    Instant On switches don't take VLAN changes over SSH. Change them in the Instant On portal or app.

## Across the network

The **VLANs** page lists every VLAN on every switch. Each cell shows how many ports carry that VLAN there; a dot means the switch doesn't have it. When the same VLAN ID has different names on different switches, the row is marked **names differ** and the odd ones out are highlighted. Click a cell to open that switch's VLAN tab.

### Change a VLAN on many switches at once

Each row has **Edit** and **Delete** buttons, and the page has **New VLAN**:

- **Edit** opens the VLAN on every switch. Rename it everywhere, tick switches to add it, or untick switches to remove it. The **Change** column shows what will happen on each switch: add, rename, remove (with how many ports lose it), or no change.
- **Delete** lists the switches that carry the VLAN, with each switch's name for it and how many ports use it. Untick the ones you want to keep it on. VLAN 1 can't be deleted.
- **New VLAN** creates a new VLAN ID on the switches you tick. An ID that already exists on any switch is refused; use that row's **Edit** instead.

**Review changes** shows the exact lines for every switch before anything is sent. **Apply** then goes through the switches one at a time and shows the result for each. A switch that rejects a line stops there without saving, and the others carry on. Port membership isn't set from here, because port names differ per switch; set it on each switch's VLANs tab. Instant On and disabled switches are listed but can't be ticked.
